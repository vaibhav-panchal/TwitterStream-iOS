Twitter Realtime Streaming Service - iOS7.0+

This sample uses the latest APIs introduced by Apple in iOS 7.0 to process realtime data from the Twitter Streaming.

VPTwitterSessionManager is the main interface which hides the implementation from the sample application.

Documentation:
A quick run of Doxygen will create API level documentation. Since XCode parse these syntax and show documentation by default, I am avoiding the extra overhead of documentation here.

In case you use IntelliJ (or sadly Eclipse :D ), please feel free to create one for you using DOxygen.
